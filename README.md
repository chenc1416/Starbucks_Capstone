## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We get the dataset from the program that creates the data simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. We want to make a recommendation engine that recommends Starbucks which offer should be sent to a particular customer.

We are interested to answer the following two questions:
1. Which offer should be sent to a particular customer to get the most benefit?
2. Which offer is the best sale offer?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

The data is contained in three files:
- `portfolio.json` - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
- `profile.json` - demographic data for each customer
- `transcript.json` - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:

`portfolio.json`
- id (string) - offer id
- offer_type (string) - the type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational
- difficulty (int) - the minimum required to spend to complete an offer
- reward (int) - the reward is given for completing an offer
- duration (int) - time for the offer to be open, in days
- channels (list of strings)

`profile.json`
- age (int) - age of the customer
- became_member_on (int) - the date when customer created an app account
- gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)
- id (str) - customer id
- income (float) - customer's income

`transcript.json`
- event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)
- person (str) - customer id
- time (int) - time in hours since the start of the test. The data begins at time t=0
- value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record
